Let’s take the following problem statement:
Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment (the model that we make should be able to predict machine failures)
Problem Description:
In an industrial setting, equipment failures can lead to costly downtime and production losses. There are certain industries whose products are in demand and giving more products in less time can lead to large profit. Our goal is to build an ML model that predicts equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance. We’ll work with historical sensor data from various machines and predict when maintenance is needed.
Data:
•	Dataset: Historical sensor data (time-series) from different machines (e.g., pumps, compressors, turbines).
•	Features: Sensor readings (vibration, temperature, pressure, etc.) collected at regular intervals.
•	Target: Binary label indicating whether maintenance was performed within a certain time window after each data point.
In our case , each and every data is with respect to time and these data(s) are collect from the past which we can use to build a model that can predict machine failures.
Timeline (1 Month):
1.	Week 1: Problem Understanding and Data Collection
o	Understand the problem domain (industrial equipment maintenance).
o	Gather historical sensor data from relevant machines.
o	Explore the dataset’s structure and features.
This includes studying about the machines of consideration . Know about the features i.e. sensor readings and understand what values these sensors sense. These things are very essential as building a model without having  a deeper understanding of the purpose and use will lead to building something that is of not much use. And as we are making the model for this particular problem statement , try to make it more personalised for this.
2.	Week 2: Data Preprocessing and EDA
Feature engineering: which includes determining the features to include or exclude . Change the values of features by applying certain conditions if required.
o	Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
o	Normalize or standardize features.
o	Perform exploratory data analysis (visualize sensor distributions, correlations, etc.).
3.	Week 3: Model Selection and Training
This is the most crucial week which involves applying of all the things done in week 1 and week 2. The first and foremost step before building a model is to split the dataset into training , cross_ validation and test sets .This is essential to check how well is our model performing. If the splitting is not done , then this may result in building a overfitting model.
Next comes, model selection. Select an appropriate model for the problem statement. If we have more than one model suitable for this dataset , an effective way to go further is to proceed with all suitable model and pick one after training and testing according to the metrics. In our case , we have to detect something , so there are only two possible cases , oneGood to go , two May fail in future ,so consider checking. Hence it is a classification problem. So we can use decision trees and a higher version of decision trees like Random Forest or XG Boost ( most preferably XG Boost) ,LSTM(a type of RNN)
Next comes the evaluation of models . Evaluate your model with popular metrics like F1 – score (confusion matrix), precision ,recall, accuracy, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error.
o	Split the data into training and validation sets.
o	Choose appropriate ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM).
o	Train baseline models and evaluate their performance.
o	Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation.
4.	Week 4: Model Refinement and Deployment
After choosing the best performing model , now comes further improvement of this model also called fine tuning. And further check the model on a new test set that the model has never seen before. This allows us to check for over fitting .
o	Fine-tune the best-performing model.
o	Evaluate the model on a separate test set.
5.	Additional Considerations:
Below are few points that can be considered to build the model for hackathon more efficiently
o	Compute Resources: 
As ML models take a lot of storage to process data , choosing right stuffs for this can lead to faster training and evaluation of the model
	Use cloud-based services for scalable compute resources.
	Set up GPU instances for faster training.
o	Collaboration: 
As we are going to do as a team , splitting of word can be done to ensure that things are done on time.
	Coordinate tasks within the team (data preprocessing, model training, etc.).
	Use version control for code collaboration.
o	Documentation and Presentation: 
In most of the hackathons , presenting the model and explaining things are as Important as building the model. So go through the model and recollect the intuition that led to building such a model.
	Document the entire process (code, findings, challenges).
	Prepare a presentation summarizing the problem, approach, and results.
